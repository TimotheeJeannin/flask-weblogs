# flask-weblogs
Displays Flask application logs on a web interface in real time. 

This was made to learn about:
* [Server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Server-sent_events)
* [Flask extension development](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/extensiondev/)

This was developed for learning purposes, hence, **this should not be used in production.**
